Past women leaders continue to be nameless and some of the contributions undervalued and forgotten. From the halls of Congress to the classroom, women and girls continue to fight for their voices to be heard. The U.S. has failed to equally represent the voices of half of the population. The U.S. ranks 90th in terms of women elected representatives in government. Notes: The term 'women of color' includes (and is not limited to) members of underrepresented backgrounds, such as African American/Black, Latino/Hispanic, Asian American Pacific Islander, Native American, etc. The people's branch or elected government is called Congress. Congress is made up of two houses, the U.S. House of Representatives with 435 seats and the U.S. Senate with 100 seats, totaling 535 seats. Each seat has a respective elected official or Congressional member.  WOMEN IN THE PAST. Despite gains in the 113th Congress, women still continue to be underrepresented. Women account for 2 percent of all individuals who have served in Congress since 1789. 44 women of color have served in Congress since 1964. Women of color represent 18.4% of the total U.S. population and remain underrepresented in Congress. In 2013, we currently have 28 women of color in Congress. 7 Asian American Pacific Islander women in Congress, 6 in the House of Representatives and 1 in the Senate, Mazie Hirono (D-HI) this past election cycle. 6 Latina/Hispanic women in Congress, 0 in the House of Representatives and 0 in the Senate. 15 African American/Black women in Congress, 5 in the House of Representatives and 0 in the Senate. There is only one Black woman who has been elected into Senate, Carol Moseley-Braun (D-IL, 1993-1999). 'Now, the numbers on participation tell the story. Women hold less than 20 percent of all seats in parliaments and legislators around the world. I'm sorry to say, here in the United States, our percentage is even a little lower, at 17 percent... And I always think to myself: What a waste, because the world cannot miss out on the talents and contributions of half the population. But these numbers tell only part of the story. We need better data and more rigorous research that documents the impact women have in public service and the obstacles that still prevent us from contributing.' - Hillary Clinton, Remarks at the Opening of the Inaugural Women in Public Service Institute at Wellesley College, June 11th, 2012.")

Women hold 18.3% of the 535 seats in Congress. 3 women serve as Delegates to the House from Guam, the Virgin Islands, and Washington DC. Congress currently has 101 women members. A truly representative Congress would have 268 women members. 78 women hold 17.9% out of 435 in the House of Representatives. 20 women hold 20% out of 100 in the Senate. WHEN WE LEAD HER FORWARD. WOMEN IN THE FUTURE. This is what Congress can look like if women lead forward now. As more women and young girls take the lead, we imagine women will be more equally represented in Congress. Congress currently has 101 women members. A truly representative Congress would have 268 women members. WHEN WOMEN ARE EQUALLY REPRESENTED. 268 women members. 98 women of color members. 13 Asian American Pacific Islander women members. 46 Latina/Hispanic women members. 74 Black/African American women members. The numbers to the left reflect what the electorate should look like at present. The future holds even more potential for women to be represented in government. The Lead Her Forward mission is to inspire young women and girls to take the lead, whether in elected office and other careers in public service. Lead Her Forward is just one of many other initiatives that will help encourage young women and girls to lead. Every woman leader has a story of challenges that they have overcome in order to move forward. Through learning about women's past and current stories and establishing a connection directly with leaders, it is our vision that gigs will also be able to see the relationship between generations and the possibilities in our own futures. Lead Her Forward recognizes that women leaders have shaped and will continue to shape the nation's future. Join us in our hopes to move our country forward, so that women everywhere will have equal economic equity and political participation.")
