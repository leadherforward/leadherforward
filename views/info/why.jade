Past women leaders continue to be nameless and some of the contributions undervalued and forgotten. From the halls of Congress to the classroom, women and girls continue to fight for their voices to be heard. The U.S. has failed to equally represent the voices of half of the population. The U.S. ranks 90th in terms of women elected representatives in government. Despite gains in the 113th Congress, women still continue to be underrepresented. Women account for 2 percent of all individuals who have served in Congress since 1789. 44 women of color have served n Congress since 1964. Note: The term 'women of color' includes (and is not limited to) members of underrepresented backgrounds, such as African American/Black, Latino/Hispanic, Asian American Pacific Islander, Native American, etc. The people's branch or elected government is called Congress. Congress is made up of two houses, the U.S. House of Representatives with 435 seats and the U.S. Senate with 100 seats, totaling 535 seats. Each seat has a respective elected official or Congressional member.")

Women of color represent 18.4% of the total U.S. population and remain underrepresented in Congress.

As more women and young girls take the lead, we imagine women will be more equally represented in Congress. A truly representative Congress would have 268 women members.

Breakdown. 268 women members. 98 women of color members. 13 Asian American Pacific Islander women members. 46 Latina/Hispanic women members. 74 Black/African American women members. The Lead Her Forward mission is to inspire young women and girls to take the lead, whether in elected office and other careers in public service. Lead Her Forward is just one of many other initiatives that will help encourage young women and girls to lead. Every woman leader has a story of challenges that they have overcome in order to move forward. Through learning about women's past and current stories and establishing a connection directly with leaders, it is our vision that gigs will also be able to see the relationship between generations and the possibilities in our own futures. Lead Her Forward recognizes that women leaders have shaped and will continue to shape the nation's future. Join us in our hopes to move our country forward, so that women everywhere will have equal economic equity and political participation.")
