Quote:
What you endure is who you are. And if you just accept and do nothing, then life goes on, but if you see it as a way for change. Life doesn't have to be so unfair. I can't change the past, but I certainly can help someone in the future so they don’t have to go through what I did.

Bio: Rosa Parks is often called the “mother of the Freedom Movement”  because of her act of resilience on a segregated bus in Montgomery, Alabama. On December 1st, 1955, Parks was told by the bus driver and a white man to give up her seat simply because she was a black woman. Parks refused and was arrested for defying segregation laws. Her action sparked the Montgomery Bus Boycott. As a child, Parks was familiar with racism. She witnessed the Ku Klux Klan march down her street, in front of her home where she lived with her mother, younger brother, and grandparents. After Parks was arrested for refusing to give up her seat, she lost her job as a seamstress and faced tough economic times. But she remained resilient and dedicated her to life to civil rights. She went on to work with African American U.S. Representative John Conyers and start the Rosa L. Parks Scholarship Foundation for college-bound high school students. In 2005, she passed away at the age of 92.

Year: 1976

Headline:
1976 - First Woman to Run for the U.S. Senate from New York
---
Quote:
“This woman’s place is in the House … the House of Representatives!” (citation)
---
Bio:
Bella (Savitzky) Abzug was born in the Bronx, New York on July 24, 1920, to Russian-Jewish immigrants, Emmanuel and Esther Tanklefsky Savitsky. She received an A.B. from Hunter College in 1942, where she was student body president. Upon graduation, entered Columbia University Law School. She served as editor of the Columbia Law Review and graduated with an LL.B in 1947.
Throughout her legal career, she defended many individuals she described as being “on the outside of power” (citation) such as: from Willie McGee, an African American man convicted of raping a white woman to individuals alleged to be “communist agents” by Senator Joseph McCarthy’s investigatory committee. She would go on to represent the West Side of Manhattan for three Congressional terms (citation).
In 1970, at age 50, Ms. Abzug made her first attempt at elected office, upon deciding to enter the race for a House of Representatives seat to represent Manhattan’s wealthy, liberal Upper West Side. She ran on an antiwar and pro-feminist platform. Throughout the campaign, she benefited from the support of celebrity entertainers and the mayor of New York City, John Lindsay.
On the first day of session of the 92nd Congress, Ms. Abzug introduced legislation demanding the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Vietnam. She also co-authored several historic bills, including Title IX, a bill which prohibits discrimination based on sex in educational opportunities by schools which receive Federal funding assistance. Today, many women and girls, who play high school and college sports, may be aware that Title IX affects athletics.
In 1974, Ms. Abzug defeated her GOP opponent, Stephen Posner, with 79 percent of the vote. Her most noteworthy contributions include the “sunshine” laws under the Freedom of Information Act, which required government hearings to be held in public. Ms. Abzug also coauthored the Child Development Act with Brooklyn Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm. She also introduced legislation aimed at increasing the rights of the LGBTQ community through amending the Civil Rights Act of 1964. She later led worthy campaigns for Senator in 1976, the New York City Democratic mayoral nomination in 1977, and for Congresswoman to represent Westchester County in 1986. She may not have won these positions, but in 1978, President Jimmy Carter named her the co-chair of the National Advisory Committee on Women.
Since then, she addressed international women’s conferences in Beijing, Nairobi, and Copenhagen. She worked to give women’s issues more prominence on the United Nations’ agenda through establishing the Women USA Fund and the Women’s Environment and Development Organization (WEDO). From 1993 to 1995, Ms. Abzug served as chair of the Commission on the Status of Women, appointed by New York City Mayor David Dinkins.
On March 31, 1998, Ms. Abzug died due to breast cancer and heart disease. A year before her death, Ms. Abzug received the Blue Beret Peacekeepers Award, the highest civilian recognition and honor at the United Nations. Her legacy and dedication to civil rights lives on.
Those who want to read more about Ms. Abzug can read her two books, “Bella: Ms. Abzug Goes to Washington” and “The Gender Gap,” the latter book co-authored with friend, Mim Kelber. She also appeared in Woody Allen’s Manhattan.

Quote:
The young Latino cashier shoved a plastic license plate flag into my face. It was decorated with a painted American flag. “You should buy this, only $3.95.” I muttered a no thank you, and he tried again, “Don’t you love the flag?”
This time I said, “I wear the flag in my heart, not on my car.” He tried again. “You can show you are American.”  I thought of my immigrant parents and felt sad for all the immigrants who are now so compelled to have the most prominent American flags. I took my change and said, “I am American. You are too. Even without a flag.”

Bio:  Helen Zia is an award-winning journalist and activist.  She has covered Asian American communities and social and political movements for more than twenty years.  Born in New Jersey and a graduate of Princeton's first co-educational class.

She has since continued to champion the rights of others such as Wen Ho Lee and has been an outspoken advocate for marriage equality.

Quote: "Every one of you has your own story of challenges overcome and barriers broken, because all over the world, women still face obstacles to political and economic participation. Cultural traditions, legal barriers, social pressures stop women from pursuing an education or starting a business or certainly running for office. And there aren’t enough mentors and role models...
Now, the numbers on participation tell the story. Women hold less than 20 percent of all seats in parliaments and legislatures around the world. I’m sorry to say, here in the United States, our percentage is even a little lower, at 17 percent. And it’s not just politics. Only 3 percent of Fortune 500 CEOs are women. And I always think to myself: What a waste, because the world cannot miss out on the talents and contributions of half the population.
But these numbers tell only part of the story. We need better data and more rigorous research that documents the impact women have on in public service and the obstacles that still prevent us from contributing." -Remarks at the Opening of the Inaugural Women in Public Service Institute at Wellesley College, June 11th, 2012

Headline: 2009 - First Latina Woman in a Presidential Cabinet and First Latina Woman elected to the California State Legislature.

Quote: “Volunteer, get involved in your community. I really do mean that because that is something that, I mean, whether you’re applying for college or applying for a job, people want to know where do you put your priorities. Are you volunteering for a cause? Are you helping your neighborhood? Are you tutoring low income kids? What are you doing with that extra time that you have? I think that’s really important for young people in high school. And then attach yourself to other folks that you want to learn from, that you think you can learn something from.”

Bio: A high school guidance counselor once told Hilda Solis she was not college material and should lower her sights and become a secretary. Thirty years later, she could say her title was secretary - OF LABOR.
As the 25th U.S. Secretary of Labor,  Secretary Solis was the first, Latina woman appointed to a cabinet position. She was also the first in her family to go to college. Solis was raised in La Puente, California, by parents who immigrated from Nicaragua and Mexico. She graduated from California State Polytechnic University, Pomona and the University of Southern California (USC) and worked for two federal agencies in Washington, DC before being elected to the State Senate in California.  She was the first Latina woman to serve in the State Senate, was re-elected in 1998, and was first female recipient of the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award in 2000 for environmental legislation she helped pass.
President Obama appointed Solis in 2009 to his cabinet and since then, Solis has presided over a tough economic climate with high unemployment.  President Obama has praised Solis, as “a tireless champion for working families” during “the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.”   
Solis will not serve in President Obama’s second term, as she has resigned “to begin a new future, and return to the people and places I love and that have inspired and shaped my life.” She stated via Twitter, “My mission over the past 4 years has been to help people and make a difference.” She will return to her native California, and it is reported she may run for office in Los Angeles, most likely for a seat on the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors.

Name: Sonia Sotomayor
---
Year: 2000
---
Headline: First Latina Supreme Court Justice in U.S. History
---
Quote: "I do know one thing about me: I don't measure myself by others' expectations or let others define my worth."
---
Bio: Growing up as girl in the Bronx with parents from Puerto Rico, Sonia Sotomayor has said she felt like she didn’t belong anywhere. "I am always looking over my shoulder, wondering if I measure up," she has said.
It was as a child that she first became interested in the law. At first, she wanted to be a police detective, but was told by a doctor that would be tough because of her diabetes (that was diagnosed when she was 8). She decided to become a judge.
Sotomayor is now a Justice in the Supreme Court - it’s 111th justice in history, its third female justice and, its first Hispanic justice. Obama administration officials say Sotomayor has brought the most judicial experience to the Supreme Court than any justice confirmed in the past 70 years. One of Sotomayor's most famous rulings was praised by baseball fans; she ended a Major League Baseball strike in 1995. In her memoir, My Beloved World, Justice Sotomayor opens up about her childhood diabetes, her father’s alcoholism, the strained relationship with her mother and her move from the projects to Princeton.

Headline:2009 - present Secretary of Health and Human Services

Quote: “American women have changed the landscape of scientific health research, medicine, and public health, and this year’s theme for Women’s History Month, “Women’s Education – Women’s Empowerment,” gives us the opportunity to reflect specifically on the contributions of a few   trailblazers within our Department who during their lives made the education and empowerment of women a priority.”

Bio: Sebelius successfully built upon her popularity and in January 2006 was tied for 20th most popular governor in the country.

As head of Health & Human Services, the former governor of Kansas is the person in charge of implementing ObamaCare. Sebelius' decisions will shape American lives--and the insurance, medical and pharmaceutical industries--for decades.
